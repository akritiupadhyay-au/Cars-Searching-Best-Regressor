# Cars: Searching Best Regressor

There are many machine learning algorithms for Regression, but deciding best number of features and best model for getting best accuracy is typical. When we select a model for prediction, then we suffer problems related to underfitting and overfitting. In real scenario, there are more cases of overfitting, which we solve through regulariztion and hyperparameter tuning. Here, I implemented the following models to check best out of them for this cars dataset:
      
              1. Linear Regression
              2. Lasso Regression
              3. Ridge Regression
              4. Elastic Net Regression
              5. Least Angle Regression
              6. Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression
              7. Support Vector Regression
              8. K Neighbors Regression
              9. Decision Tree Regression
              10. Random Forest Regression
              11. XG Boost Regression
